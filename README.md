# VS Code settings for web developer / 28.04.2025

These VS Code settings and plugins are designed to seriously boost your productivity, automate boring tasks, and help you write clean, organized code. They handle tons of routine work — creating files, closing and renaming tags, autocompleting classes and paths, formatting code, checking spelling in variables and comments — so you can focus on logic and creativity instead of technical busywork.

The result? Your code looks cleaner, you work faster, make fewer mistakes, and instantly see your changes. Development feels less like grinding gears and more like smooth, controlled racing.

<h2>Inside the archive:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fonts — handpicked for writing clean, readable code.</li>
  <li>Plugins.txt — a full list and descriptions of recommended plugins.</li>
  <li>install-extensions.sh — a bash script to install all plugins at once. Just run: bash install-extensions.sh.</li>
  <li>settings.json — ready-to-go editor settings.</li>  
</ul>

<h2>Setup steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download all files to your computer.</li>
  <li>Install the provided fonts.</li>
  <li>Install all the plugins (manually or using the script).</li>
  <li>Only after that — import the editor settings.</li>
</ol>
